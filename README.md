# REDOX TO DO APP

The following project was created using Ruby on Rails. It is a To-Do-List. The main purpose is to create a list of tasks to do in the future. It will allow the user to create a new task with the following information: Completed, Name, Description, Classification and Deadline.  With two tables that will display the tasks if either they have been completed or not. 

This application integrates essential features like a Navigation Bar, user account creation, Sign-Up, and Log-In functionalities. Users can create personal To-Do Lists by registering an account, with various views for Log-In, Sign-Up, and Profile Editing. The Navigation Bar facilitates easy navigation with links like "About Us," "List of Tasks," "Sign-up," and "Log-In," dynamically adjusting to show "New Task," "Sign-Out," and "Edit Profile" options post-login. Styling maintains brand consistency by incorporating the company's website background and logo, utilizing boxes with opacity for a luxurious aesthetic. Overall, the application aims to optimize user experience through intuitive navigation and personalized task management.
